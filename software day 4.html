2.	How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
How effective cost control contributes to the success of a software project. Cost control helps to keep projects on budget. It starts with a well planned budget that includes a risk allowance. Cost control reduces risks by identifying potential cost overruns early and adjusting plans to mitigate financial risks. Cost control improves resource allocation by optimizing resource utilization to maximize efficiency.
Strategies that can be used to prevent budget overruns. Having a well planned budget that includes a risk allowance. Tracking actual costs against the budget and taking corrective action when needed. Identifying variances early and taking action to address them.
3.	Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Comparing. Waterfall is a linear, sequential approach to project management where each phase of the project is completed before moving to the next. Agile is iterative, flexible approach to project management.
Contrasting. In waterfall risks are addressed only at the beginning whereas in agile risks are managed continuously, sprint by sprint. In waterfall heavy documentation is required whereas in agile minimal documentation is done since it focuses more on working software. In waterfall one final product at the end whereas in agile deliverables are produced regularly in short cycles.
Waterfall. Advantages. It has a clear structure that is, the process is well defined. It is easier to manage due to its sequential nature, project managers can easily track progress, timelines and costs. It is well suited for simple projects. Disadvantages. There is limited room for continuous feedback from customers. Changes in the middle of the project are difficult and expensive to implement. 
Agile. Advantages. Early testing and frequent releases ensures that potential issues are identified and resolved early. Due to iterative development, parts of the project can be delivered quickly and improvements made in each cycle. Disadvantages. Requires constant involvement from customers and stakeholders, which can be time consuming. It requires experienced teams that can handle the autonomy and adaptability needed. It can be difficult to predict the final scope, cost or timeline due to its evolving nature.  
4.	In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile. Projects with uncertain or evolving requirements. Projects with high complexity or uncertainty. For example: building a web application for a startup, marketing campaign with dynamic elements.
Waterfall. Projects with well defined and stable requirements. Projects with a clear timeline and predictable deliverables. For example: a government project with a fixed budget and scope. Constructing a large building. 
5.	What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Methods. Testing- carrying out various tests e.g. unit testing, performance testing and security testing. Reviews- reviewing code for issues like errors and security vulnerabilities. Planning- this outlines quality standards, expectations, roles responsibilities, goals and testing strategies.
Importance of maintaining high standards. This results in software that is more reliable, efficient and user friendly.
6.	How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
How a defined scope helps. It sets boundaries y defining what’s included in the project and what’s not. It helps manage expectations and improve communication with stakeholders. It determines on how to verify and approve completed work. It assigns tasks and responsibilities to team members.
Work Breakdown Structure. It is a hierarchical decomposition of a project into smaller more manageable tasks.
Usefulness. By breaking down the work into smaller tasks, it becomes easier to estimate time, costs and resources for ach task. Smaller, well defined tasks make it easier to identify potential risks and take proactive measures. It provides a clear framework for monitoring and controlling project progress, ensuring that tasks are completed on schedule.
7.	What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
Benefits of developing a detailed project schedule. A detailed project schedule outlines the start and end dates for each task, providing a clear understanding of when work needs to be completed. This helps ensure that the project is completed on time. When team members know exactly what they are responsible for and when tasks need to be completed, it improves accountability and helps ensure deadlines are met. The schedule helps identify task dependencies that is, which tasks need to be completed before others can start, ensuring the project progresses smoothly without delays.
How Gantt charts assist in the scheduling process. They provide a clear, easy to understand visual of the project timeline, showing the duration of each task and when it starts and ends. They allow for setting and tracking key project milestones, helping teams and stakeholders know when significant deliverables are done. By showing the timeline and dependencies in one place, Gantt charts promote better coordination and collaboration among team members and stakeholders. They show the relationships between tasks, such as which tasks are dependent on others, helping ensure that the project flows in the right order.
8.	What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
